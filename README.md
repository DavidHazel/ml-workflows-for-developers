# Machine learning workflows for developers

This repository has materials from a hands-on tutorial on machine learning workflows (and using OpenShift for these).  We'll have more documentation for how to run the lab on your own time in the future, but for now you can run the notebooks and build pipelines.  To run our lab on an OpenShift cluster (including on your personal computer with minishift or `oc cluster`), run the following command:

`oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willb/ml-workflows-for-developers/summit2019/resources.yaml`

Our slides from presenting the lab at Red Hat Summit 2019 [are online](./ml-workflows-for-developers.pdf).
